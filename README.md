**1.1 Reason for project formation**

• Huge and Complex Data from E-commerce Transactions
E-commerce platforms like Amazon have to manage a huge amount of data from millions of transactions every day. This data is complex, diverse in types (products, customers, revenue, profits, etc.) and often grows continuously.Processing big data without a suitable management system will lead to difficulties in storing, organizing and extracting information, making it difficult for businesses to have an overall and detailed view of their business operations.

• Lack of information to support strategic decision making
To optimize business strategies, businesses need accurate data and in-depth analysis of consumer behavior, shopping trends, and factors affecting sales. However, manually analyzing and extracting this information from raw data is very difficult and prone to errors.Lack of reporting and analytics can make it difficult for businesses to forecast demand, manage inventory, optimize pricing, and develop effective marketing strategies.

• Competitive Needs and Improved Customer Experience
In a highly competitive environment, e-commerce businesses must leverage data to optimize processes, develop products, and improve customer experiences.Without an effective data warehouse system, companies may miss out on important opportunities to create personalized shopping experiences, quickly respond to customer needs, and maintain a competitive advantage.
